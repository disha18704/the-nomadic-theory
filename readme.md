AI Travel Planner


What This AI Will Do

This project builds an AI Travel Planner that creates complete, personalized travel plans for users.
All the user has to do is tell the AI:

-their budget
-how many days they want to travel
-the type of trip they prefer (beach, mountains, culture, adventure)
-and optionally upload a photo of themselves

The AI then generates 2–3 customized itineraries that are realistic, budget-aware, and ready to use.

Feature 1: Smart Itinerary Generator
What it does

This part of the AI acts like a personal travel agent. It:

-Picks 2–3 destinations that fit the user’s budget and vibe
-Builds a day-by-day travel plan
-Suggests activities, food spots, stays, and travel modes
-Provides a clear cost estimate for each plan
-Makes everything simple, clean, and easy to read

Why this matters

Planning a trip manually is tiring and time-consuming. The AI automates all the searching, comparing, and planning so users get instant, meaningful travel options without effort.

Feature 2: Lightweight RAG System (AI’s Internal Memory)
What it does

This system gives the AI a small, curated internal memory containing:

-popular destinations
-average travel + stay costs
-highlights and activities
-food and stay suggestions

a few example images of each place (optional)

Whenever the user asks for a plan, the AI looks into this memory to stay accurate and grounded.

Why this matters

This prevents the AI from making unrealistic or random suggestions.
It ensures the itineraries:

-match actual costs
-include real activities
-fit the user’s preferences
-stay practical for real travel

It also keeps the MVP light, fast, and easy to maintain.

Feature 3: Computer Vision Personalization (Using User’s Photo)
What it does

Users can upload their own photo, and the system will generate fun, personalized images showing how the user might look at the destination.

Examples:

-The user standing on a Goa beach
-The user in front of a fort in Jaipur
-The user at a café in Shimla
-The user on a cliffside viewpoint in Manali

These images are then added to the final PDF itinerary.

Why this matters

Travel plans become more:

-engaging
-shareable
-personal

and exciting

Instead of a dull PDF, users get a visually rich, creative itinerary that feels tailor-made for them.

This also increases user trust and emotional connection with the itinerary—people can literally see themselves there.

How Everything Works Together

User gives the AI their trip details + optional photo

AI selects the best matching destinations
